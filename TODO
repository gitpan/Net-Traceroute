* More testing would be good.  I'm generally getting sick of my poor test factoring.
* I hate the possibly interactive nature of make test.  Think about
  what to do about it.
* Normalize icmp_map and regular expressions derived from it.
* Stanley Hopcroft <Stanley.Hopcroft@IPAustralia.Gov.AU> has reported
  some issues with the timeout functionality in this code.  Haven't
  had copious free time to examine the issue.  This should be a test
  case.
