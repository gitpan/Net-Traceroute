	* First ChangeLog entry.
	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Bumped version to 1.01
	** Changed Net::Inet to Socket.  Only needed inet_aton and inet_ntoa.
	** host(): Wrapped inet_aton in an eval.
	* test.pl: Rewrote test 3 to be slightly more general, as too
	many operating systems have restrictions on what you can trace
	to.  Ask user if test is difficult.
