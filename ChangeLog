	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Version number bump.
	** Add fix for Redhat FC5's newest random patches from Keven Nolish.
	** Fix for timeout problems:
	*** Use sysread, not read.
	*** Remove call to eof immediately after pipe creation -- plays
	    badly with nonblocking & sysread.  Check performed elsehow.

2006-11-04  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Start towards fixing timeout issues -- mark socket non-blocking
	   (duh); actually accumulate text rather than smashing the buffer.

2005-07-09  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Fix regexp bug in how numeric icmp output codes were handled.

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Update parser to deal with traceroute on current linux.
	   Apparently some bozo thought some extra spacing here and there
	   would be cute.
	** Version bump to 1.08.
	* TODO:
	** New file.

2000-11-17  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Added a default value to debug instance variable, to avoid
	perl warning
	** Incremented version number to 1.03.
	* test.pl:
	** Turned on perl warnings.

2000-08-15  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Added error checking around our use of IO::Pipe.
	** Incremented version number for release

1999-11-28  Daniel Hagerty  <hag@linnaean.org>

	* First ChangeLog entry.
	* Traceroute.pm:
	** Bumped version to 1.01
	** Changed Net::Inet to Socket.  Only needed inet_aton and inet_ntoa.
	** host(): Wrapped inet_aton in an eval.
	* test.pl: Rewrote test 3 to be slightly more general, as too
	many operating systems have restrictions on what you can trace
	to.  Ask user if test is difficult.
