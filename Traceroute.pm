# Could eventually be broken into several classes that know how to

# Has a couple of random useful hooks for child classes to override.

=head1 NAME

Net::Traceroute - traceroute(1) functionality in perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Traceroute;
    $tr = Net::Traceroute->new(host=> "life.ai.mit.edu");
    if($tr->found) {
	my $hops = $tr->hops;
	if($hops > 1) {
	    print "Router was " .
		$tr->hop_query_host($tr->hops - 1, 1) . "\n";
	}
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements traceroute(1) functionality for perl5.  It
allows you to trace the path IP packets take to a destination.  It is
currently implemented as a parser around the system traceroute
command.

=head1 OVERVIEW

A new Net::Traceroute object must be created with the I<new> method.
Depending on exactly how the constructor is invoked, it may perform
the traceroute immediately, or it may return a "template" object that
can be used to set parameters for several subsequent traceroutes.

Methods are available for accessing information about a given
traceroute attempt.  There are also methods that view/modify the
options that are passed to the object's constructor.

To trace a route, UDP packets are sent with a small TTL (time-to-live)
field in an attempt to get intervening routers to generate ICMP
TIME_EXCEEDED messages.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

    $obj = Net::Traceroute->new([base_port	=> $base_port,]
				[max_ttl	=> $max_ttl,]
				[host		=> $host,]
				[queries	=> $queries,]
				[query_timeout	=> $query_timeout,]
				[timeout	=> $timeout,]);
    $frob = $obj->new([options]);

This is the constructor for a new Net::Traceroute object.  If given
C<host>, it will actually perform the traceroute; otherwise it will return
an empty template object.  This can be used to setup a template object
with some preset defaults for firing off multiple traceroutes.

Given an existing Net::Traceroute object $obj as a template, you can
call $obj->new() with the usual parameters.  The same rules apply
about defining host; that is, traceroute will be run if it is defined.
You can always pass host => undef in the constructor call.

To use a template objects to perform a traceroute, you clone it and
pass a host option.

Possible options are:

B<host> - A host to traceroute to.  If you don't set this, you get a
Traceroute object with no traceroute data in it.  The module always
uses IP addresses internally and will attempt to lookup host names via
inet_aton.

B<base_port> - Base port number to use for the UDP queries.
Traceroute assumes that nothing is listening to port C<base_port> to
C<base_port + (nhops - 1)>
where nhops is the number of hops required to reach the destination
address.  Default is what the system traceroute uses (normally 33434).
C<Traceroute>'s C<-p> option.

B<max_ttl> - Maximum number of hops to try before giving up.  Default
is what the system traceroute uses (normally 30).  C<Traceroute>'s
C<-m> option.

B<queries> - Number of times to send a query for a given hop.
Defaults to whatever the system traceroute uses (3 for most
traceroutes).  C<Traceroute>'s C<-q> option.

B<query_timeout> - How many seconds to wait for a response to each
query sent.  Uses the system traceroute's default value of 5 if
unspecified.  C<Traceroute>'s C<-w> option.

B<timeout> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the traceroute to
complete.  If not specified, the traceroute will not return until the
host has been reached, or traceroute counts to infinity (C<max_ttl> *
C<queries> * C<query_timeout>).  Note that this option is implemented
by Net::Traceroute, not the underlying traceroute command.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Controlling traceroute invocation

Each of these methods return the current value of the option specified
by the corresponding constructor option.  They will set the object's
instance variable to the given value if one is provided.

Changing an instance variable will only affect newly performed
traceroutes.  Setting a different value on a traceroute object that
has already performed a trace has no effect.

See the constructor documentation for information about each
method/constructor option.

=head2 Obtaining information about a Trace

These methods return information about a traceroute that has already
been performed.

Any of the methods in this section that return a count of something or
want an I<N>th type count to identify something employ one based
counting.

=over 4

=item stat

Returns the status of a given traceroute object.  One of
TRACEROUTE_OK, TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT, or TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN (each defined
as an integer).  TRACEROUTE_OK will only be returned if the host was
actually reachable.

=item found

Returns 1 if the host was found, undef otherwise.

=item hops

Returns the number of hops that it took to reach the host.

=item hop_queries(HOP)

Returns the number of queries that were sent for a given hop.  This
should normally be the same for every query.

=item hop_query_stat(HOP, QUERY)

Return the status of the given HOP's QUERY.  The return status can be
one of the following (each of these is actually an integer constant
function defined in Net::Traceroute's export list):

=over 4

=item TRACEROUTE_OK

Reached the host, no problems.

=item TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT

This query timed out.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN

Your guess is as good as mine.  Shouldn't happen too often.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_NET

This hop returned an ICMP Network Unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_HOST

This hop returned an ICMP Host Unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_PROTO

This hop returned an ICMP Protocol unreachable.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_NEEDFRAG

Indicates that you can't reach this host without fragmenting your
packet further.  Shouldn't happen in regular use.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_SRCFAIL

A source routed packet was rejected for some reason.  Shouldn't happen.

=item TRACEROUTE_UNREACH_FILTER_PROHIB

A firewall or similar device has decreed that your traffic is
disallowed by administrative action.  Suspect sheer, raving paranoia.

=item TRACEROUTE_BSDBUG

The destination machine appears to exhibit the 4.[23]BSD time exceeded
bug.

=back

=item hop_query_host(HOP, QUERY)

Return the dotted quad IP address of the host that responded to HOP's
QUERY.

=item hop_query_time(HOP, QUERY)

Return the round trip time associated with the given HOP's query.  If
your system's traceroute supports fractional second timing, so
will Net::Traceroute.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Net::Traceroute parses the output of the system traceroute command.
As such, it may not work on your system.  Support for more traceroute
outputs (e.g. Windows, HPUX) could be done, although currently the
code assumes there is "One true traceroute".

The actual functionality of traceroute could also be implemented
natively in perl or linked in from a C library.

As of 0.7 (the first public release) I consider the interface stable.
Violent changes to interface are always possible, but I will retain
compatibility with this interface in future releases.
