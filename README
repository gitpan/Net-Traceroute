This is version 1.11 of Net::Traceroute.  Users upgrading from before
version 1.04, please note that there has been an interface change.
Your program may not work.  Please see "CLONING SUPPORT BEFORE 1.04"
in the pod documentation.

New with this version includes support for parsing traceroute text (as
opposed to having to run traceroute itself), some ipv6 bug fixes, and
a completely reworked test suite.

Net::Traceroute is available from CPAN and my home
page.  My CPAN area is authors/id/H/HA/HAG, and my home page is
currently http://www.linnaean.org/~hag/ .  I hope you find the
module useful.

Example:

use Net::Traceroute;
$tr = Net::Traceroute->new(host => "life.ai.mit.edu");

if($tr->found) {
    my $hops = $tr->hops;
    if($hops == 1) {
	print "Same subnet\n";
    } else {
	print "Last router is " .
	    $tr->hop_query_host($hops - 1, 0) . "\n";
    }
}
