This is version 1.05 of Net::Traceroute.  Users upgrading from
previous versions, please note that there has been an interface
change.  Your program may not work.  Please see "CLONING SUPPORT
BEFORE 1.04" in the pod documentation.

Net::Traceroute is available from CPAN and my home
page.  My CPAN area is authors/id/H/HA/HAG, and my home page is
currently http://www.linnaean.org/~hag/ .  I hope you find the
module useful.

Changes from previous version includes bug fixes, traceroute6 support
(thanks to Mohacsi Janos <mohacsi@ik.bme.hu>), better subclassing
support, and new traceroute options.


This traceroute module works by parsing your vendor's traceroute
command.  As such, some systems may not work; Windows is known not to.
Patches to support your favorite OS are welcome.

Example:

use Net::Traceroute;
$tr = Net::Traceroute->new(host=>"life.ai.mit.edu");

if($tr->found) {
    my $hops = $tr->hops;
    if($hops == 1) {
	print "Same subnet\n";
    } else {
	print "Last router is " .
	    $tr->hop_query_host($hops - 1, 0) . "\n";
    }
}
