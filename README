I needed to talk to traceroute within some perl scripts, and actually
use the information within the traceroute.  Nothing hard, nothing
wierd, just traceroute.  If you don't know what traceroute is, you
probably don't care about this module.

I have released version 0.9 of Net::Traceroute to CPAN and my home
page.  My CPAN area is authors/id/H/HA/HAG, and my home page is
currently http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/hag/ .  I hope you find the
module useful.

Example:

use Net::Traceroute;
$tr = Net::Traceroute->new(host=>"life.ai.mit.edu");

if($tr->found) {
    my $hops = $tr->hops;
    if($hops == 1) {
	print "Same subnet\n";
    } else {
	print "Last router is " .
	    $tr->hop_query_host($hops - 1, 1) . "\n";
    }
}
